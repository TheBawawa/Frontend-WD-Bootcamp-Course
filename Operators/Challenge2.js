// Do both of the blocks of code result in the same answer? Which one you recommend and why?

// Snippet 1
const firstNumber = 20;
const secondNumber = '20';

const result = firstNumber === secondNumber;
console.log(result)

// Snippet 2
const FirstNumber = 20;
const SecondNumber = '20';

const Result = FirstNumber === SecondNumber;
console.log(Result);

// They are basically the same snippet. Would recommend either i guess
