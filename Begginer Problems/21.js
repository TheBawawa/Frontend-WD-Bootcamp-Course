// I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        sum1 += arr1[i];
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
        sum += arr2[i];
    }

    return sum; //something went wrong
}
